## -*- awk -*- Emacs highlighting for AWK looks nice

## QUERIES separated by single-hash H1 headers
## COMMENTS are double-hash H2 headers
## currently no quote-escapes nor sanity-checking, sorry
## eg: https://twitter.com/search?q=foo%20OR%20bar%20AND%20(baz%20OR%20wibble)&src=typed_query&f=live

## note to self: trying to anchor searches to user mentions ("+@foo")
## tends to yield poor results over/above free text search; possibly
## this is a Twitter search backend restriction for CPU use, or a
## safety measure?

## helper: <foo bar> expands to: "foo bar" OR "FooBar"
